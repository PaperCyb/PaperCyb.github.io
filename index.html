      <p>The cold wind grazes my skin, chilling my every bone, cold and hungry I continue to walk exhausted from hiking, 
        my dad points, I follow where his hand was pointing then I see it a fast food restaurant nearby a feeling of happiness 
        overtakes all my emotions, my face quickly turning in to a smile. 
        As I continue to walk I entered the restaurant just then the aroma fills my nose the amazing smell of food was enough to 
        captivate me into it I didn't even have to look at it, just then I knew that whatever was waiting for me their would be 
        an amazing meal small or not there it is presented to me the fries, I get closer take a better look It looks amazing the 
        way its warms my finger the moment I grab it I bite without thinking my mouth instantly gets overtaken by such flavor I 
        want more its an addicting taste it warms my mouth nicely just by eating it make me forget all about my exhaustion It was
         truly worth it the salt, the taste of potato, the softness yet the hardness at the same time mixes quite well its fried 
         to absolute perfection.

        <p>French Fries are such an amazing invention but do you ever wonder where the name “french” in french fries comes from? 
          Do you ever wonder why or who made french fries? Well, the history of french fries dates way back to the 1680s, french 
          fries were made in Belgium in desperate times as the villagers in Belgium usually ate fried fish but all the fish froze
           in the cold waters freezing up so instead of accidentally putting themselves in harms way to get the frozen fish they 
           resulted to cutting up potatoes and then frying them then boom the first time french fries were ever made but french 
           fries aren't actually french they got that name as Americans had found the dish and then they thought of it they 
           thought of the most common language in Belgium is french so their they had it they ended up calling this food french 
           fries.

        <p>To be honest, you can spot french fries almost everywhere in almost every cartoon I mean it is quite a popular snack but its also quite common and people just love to consume it you can find this food in cartoons, games, and well anything that has fiction like even this one show steven universe has a whole episode showing a part where they make fries but they made it look quite fancy for it just being purely potato and the main reason they were making fries was over a dispute on which person cooks better so steven made fries and they looked amazing, they even added ketchup inside the fries itself so when the other character that tried it was surprising to find out that the fries had ketchup inside it solving their question as why there was no ketchup with it, it's kinda brilliant if you ask me and when I first ever saw those In that cartoon I  myself wanted to try it so bad like at that point it wasn't a want it was a need.

        <h3 class="stext">Section 5</h3>
        <p>This food doesn't exactly have an extremely deep history with me and my family but it is one of the very first fast foods I ever ate and to be honest I fell in love with it I loved potatoes when I was a little kid and I still do just the aroma was amazing I got so interested in it and every time I saw videos about it I really wanted to make it I don't why but I have such an interest in fries for no reason but it's amazing, so can you really blame me on wanting to rant about french fries? it tastes good, it smells good, it's not too big but neither too small it's a perfect shape and just the right amount of size the salt is also an amazing addition it goes perfectly with it but fries are such a tasty small snack it's so addicting I could eat it without a single bit of hesitance I just love everything about it
