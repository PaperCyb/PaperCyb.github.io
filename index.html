    <p class="art">Networking is the practice of connecting two or more computing devices together for the purpose of sharing data. In a typical home network, each device is assigned a unique network address called an IP address. This allows data to be transferred to and from each device allowing you to browse websites, stream content, and share files. The devices that make up a network are called nodes. Nodes can be computers, printers, servers, routers, and more. The most common type of network is the Local Area Network (LAN). A LAN is a network that connects devices within a relatively small area such as a home or office. The most common type of LAN is the Ethernet LAN. Ethernet is a networking standard that allows devices to communicate with each other using cables. </p>
